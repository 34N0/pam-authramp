# Directory where tally information is stored.
# Each user has a separate file in this directory to track authentication failures.

# Number of allowed free authentication attempts before applying delays.
# During these free tries, the module allows authentication without introducing delays.
# free_tries = 6
#
# Base delay applied to each authentication failure.
# This is the initial delay applied after the free tries are exhausted.
# base_delay_seconds = 30
#
# Multiplier for the delay calculation based on the number of failures.
# The delay for each subsequent failure is calculated as follows:
# delay = ramp_multiplier * (fails - free_tries) * ln(fails - free_tries) + base_delay_seconds
# ramp_multiplier = 50
#
# Even lock out the root user. Enabling this can be dangerous and may result in a total system lockout.
# For auditing purposes, the tally will still be created for the root user, even if this setting is disabled.
# If you plan to enable this feature, make sure there isn't any tally stored under <tally_dir>/root, or you risk immediate lockout.
